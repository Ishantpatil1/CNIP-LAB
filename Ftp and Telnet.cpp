Steps for FTP:

Understand the Purpose of FTP:
Used for file transfers between computers or between a computer and a server.

Setup for FTP:
Ensure an FTP client software like FileZilla is installed on your system.

Connect to the FTP Server:
Open the FTP client software.
Enter the host address (e.g., ftp.example.com), username, and password.
Click on "Connect."

Explore the Server:
Use the remote directory pane (on the server) and local directory pane (on your computer) to navigate through files.

Perform FTP Operations:
Upload Files: Drag files from the local directory to the server's directory.
Download Files: Drag files from the server directory to your local directory.
Other actions: Rename, delete, or create directories on the server.

End Session:
Disconnect from the server after completing the file transfer.

Used to remotely access and control another computer.

Setup for Telnet:
Ensure Telnet is enabled on your system.
For Windows: Go to "Control Panel" > "Programs" > "Turn Windows features on or off" > Enable Telnet Client.
Obtain the domain name (e.g., example.com) or IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) of the remote system.

Start a Telnet Session:
Open the command prompt or terminal.

Type the command:
bash
Copy code
telnet <hostname_or_IP>
Example:
